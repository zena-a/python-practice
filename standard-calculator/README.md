# Standard Calculator
This program simulates the functions of a standard calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Utilizes modular design with custom functions and dictionaries for efficient computation. Additionally, it uses recursion, a technique where a function calls itself and an entry point to execute the main function. 

## My Learnings
- Implementing basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Creating modular and reusable functions. 
- Using dicitonaries to map symbols to functions. 
- Handling user input separately from calculations and controlling program flow for better readability and scalability.
- Understanding and implementing recursion as a control structure. 

## How To Use
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script 'main.py' using the command 'python main.py'.
5. Follow the prompts to calculate two numbers with your preferred operation. 
6. You can choose to keep working with the result or make a new calculation. 
7. The program keeps running until you exit.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- 'main.py': The main Python script that contains the calculator functions and program's logic.
- README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
