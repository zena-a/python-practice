# Hangman Game
A simply hangmane game built with Python. Utilizes random module, loops, if statements, and custom functions. The user is assigned 6 lives and has to guess the correct letters contained in the chosen word. 

## My Learning
While building this Hangman Game, I learned:
- How to use the 'enumerate' function to iterate over both elements and their indices in a sequence.
- The benefits of creating and using custom functions to modularize code and improve readability even with functional programming.
- The usage of modules to organize and separate different aspects of the program.
- The importance of planning and strcuturing code for a better user experience.

## How To Use
1. Make sure the latest version of Python is installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project file. 
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the python script 'main.py'.
5. Guess letters to complete the hidden word before you run out of lives.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following five (5) files:
- 'main.py': The main Python script that contains the Hangman gaeme logic.
- 'words.py': Custom module that contains teh list of words for the game, and the letters from the English alphabet.
- 'ascii.py': Custom module that provides ASCII art for the Hangman stages.
- 'clearscreen.py': Custom module to clear the terminal or command prompt.
- 'README.md': Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
