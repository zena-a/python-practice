# Highest Bidder
This program is a simple command-line application built with Python. It uses a dictionary to store the names of bidders and their corresponding bids. The program prompts the user for their name and bid amount, and loops until the user ends the bid. The program then finds the highest bidder and displays the winner along with their bid. 

## My Learning
- Using dictionaries to store and manage data.
- Using loops to collect bidder information and conditional statements to control program flow.
- Modularizing code by creating and calling functions. 
- Using clearscreen to enhance user experience in the terminal.

## How To Use
1. Make sure the latest version of Python is installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project file. 
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the python script 'main.py' using 'python main.py'.
5. Follow the prompts to input bidder names and bids.
6. You can end the program to find out the highest bid. 

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- 'main.py': The main Python script that implements the Highest Bdder program.
- 'clearscreen.py': A custom module to clear the screen for a better user experience. 
- README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
