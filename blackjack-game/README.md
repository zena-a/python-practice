# Blackjack Game
A Python implementation of the classic card game "Blackjack", also called "21". The user competes against a computer dealer to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game was built with custom functions, random module, os and platform module, and interactive gameplay with ascii art. 

## My Learning
- Working with lists to manage cards and gameplay.
- Utilizing the 'random' module to simulate card dealing and gameplay randomness.
- Creating custom functions for different aspects of the game for better code modularity.
- Handling conditional statements to evaluate player and dealer scores. 
- Incorporating ascii for an engaging visual experience. 
- Implementing a game loop for repeated gameplay and decision making.
- Applying user input and console clearing for interactive gameplay.
- Structuring code to enhance readability and maintainability.

## How To Use
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script 'main.py' using the command 'python main.py'.
5. Follow the prompts to choose to draw another card or pass during your turn. 
6. The game will display results and ask if you want to restart.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- 'main.py': The main Python script that contains the games logic.
- 'ascii.py': The ascii art python script that contains the game's logo.
- README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
