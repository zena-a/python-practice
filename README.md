## Projects
Below is a list of the practice projects included in this repository:
<ul>
  <li>
    text-adventure-game: The user selects different choices that affect the game's storyline. Utilizes ASCII art, conditional statements, while loop, and user-defined clear() method to clear terminal/console screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    rock-paper-scissors: The user plays against the computer that produces random results against the player's choices. Utilizes ASCII art, conditional statements, while loop, user-defined clear() method, and random module. 
  </li>
  <li>
    password-generator: The user can generate a new password with randomized letters, numbers, and symbols based on the totals entered from the prompts. Utilizes random module (shuffle and choice method) and for loops.
  </li>
  <li>
    hangman game: A classic hangman game where the user has to guess the correct letters contained in the chosen word. Utilizes custom functions, random module, and iterating through a sequence (enumerate method).
  </li>
  <li>
    caesar-cipher: The classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique that takes user input for a message and a shift value to encrypt or decrypt the message. Demonstrates fundamental cryptography concepts and string manipulation in Python (isalpha() and isupper) as well as converting character types to their unicode value.
  </li>
  <li>
    highest-bidder: A blind auction using a dictionary to store bidders' names and bids. Compares the bids to find the highest one, once there are no more bidders, and declares the winner.
  </li>
  <li>
    standard-calculator: Simulates the functions of a standard calculator. Supports basic arithmetic operations and utilizes modular design with custom funcitons, dictionaries, and recursion for efficient computation.
  </li>
  <li>
    blackjack-game: Implementation of the class card game "Blackjack", where user has to compete against a computer dealier to achieve a hand value as close to 21 without exceeding it. Utilizes random, os, and platform module, ascii art, custom functions and conditional statements to create an interactive gameplay experience.
  </li>
</ul>
