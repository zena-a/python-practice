# Caesar Cipher
This program implements the classic Caesar Cipher technique, a historic encryption and decryption method. It takes user input for a message and a shift value, allowing for both encoding and decoding processes. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of cryptography concepts and the manipulation of strings in Python. 

## My Learning
- Applying the caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Handling string manipulation and character shifting in Python. 
- Implementing user input validation for direction selection. 

## How To Use
1. Make sure the latest version of Python is installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project file. 
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the python script 'main.py' using 'python main.py'.
5. Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message by your preferred shift number. 
6. You can choose to continue by typing 'yes' or 'no' at the next prompt.
