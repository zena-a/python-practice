# Rock, Paper, Scissors
The game utilizes the random module to generate randomized options as the user's opponent. ASCII art was used for visual elements, along with if..elif..else statements to compare the player's and computer's input. A while loop was included for game play until user chooses to no longer play. 
The screen is cleared for each new round using the user-defined clear() method.

## My Learning
Importing the random module to generate randomized input.
Implementing a while loop for continuous gameplay.
Basic error handling using an if statement.
A try..catch block could have been used for better error handling. 

## How to Play
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script main.py.
5. Follow the prompts and make choices to progress through the game.
6. Enjoy trying to predict the computer's choice :)

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- main.py: The main Python script that contains the game logic.
- ascii_art.py: A separate file that stores ASCII art used for visuals in the game.
- clearscreen.py: A separate file that contains the clear() function definition.
- README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
