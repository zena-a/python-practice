# Guess The Number
This is a simple "Guess The Number" game built with Python. The game randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, then prompts the user to guess 
the number selected. The player is given a limited number of attempts, which is determined by the difficulty level chosen (easy or hard). This game was built using custom functions, while loops, conditional statements, contsts, and variable scoping. It also uses multiline comments in Python by following the triple-quoted string format. 

## My Learning
- Selection construct using the if-elif-else statements to check the user's guess and provide the correct feedback. 
- Iteraction construct using the while loop to create the game loop, and allowin the player to keep guessing until they either win or run out of attempts. 
- Constant variables to store values that should not be modified during the program's execution. 
- Understood variable scope and how they affect accessibility of variables with different parts of the code. 
- Multiline comments using the triple-quoted strngs, which helped in documenting and explaining code blocks. 
- Ensuring the code is readable and maintainable while using the programming elements. 

## How To Use
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script 'main.py' using the command 'python main.py'.
5. Follow the prompts to choose the difficulty level.
6. Depending on the level, you will have limited attempts to guess the randomly generated number. 
7. Keep guessing until you guess the number correctly or run out of attempts.  
8. You win if you guess the number correctly or you lose if you run out of attempts.
