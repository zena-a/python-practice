# Text Adventure Game
The game utilizes if, elif, and else statements to control the storyline and player choices. It incorporates ASCII art for visual elements, which are stored in a separate file. As well as a clear() function built using os and platform modules, to automatically clear the terminal and console after user input.

## My Learning
Gained a better understanding of conditional statements (if, elif, else) to create branching paths.
Understood how to import and utilize the os and platform libraries to create a clear method for clearing the terminal/console screen on different operating systems.
Learned to implement a while loop to control user input for error handling. Later I realized, a while loop could work well to control game flow if there was more branches in the storyline. 

## How to Play
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script main.py.
5. Follow the prompts and make choices to progress through the game.
6. Enjoy the text-based adventure and explore different storylines based on your decisions :)

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- main.py: The main Python script that contains the game logic.
- ascii_art.py: A separate file that stores ASCII art used for visuals in the game.
- clearscreen.py: A separate file that contains the clear() function definition.
- README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
